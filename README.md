MScR Thesis - Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Large Scale Neuronal Recordings

This is my main academic project for my Master's by research degree.
The project contains three main ipynb notebooks. Those are: simAndReduction, simulation_and_reduction_script_randomOnly, and data_analysis.
Those who are not familiar with this project should read these three notebooks subsequently.

The repository also contains two development directories. In these, I am try to optimize some of the main problems encountered in the three main notebooks. These are, solving numpy broadcast instead of combining for loops and parallelizing the script to generate data.

Some parts of the code are not commented. This is a rookie mistake, as this was my first bigger project and I implemented all the code myself.

I continuously comment, optimize and improve the code.
